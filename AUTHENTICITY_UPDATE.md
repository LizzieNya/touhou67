# Authenticity Update - Touhou 6 (EoSD) Accurate

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Max Power System
**Before**: 200 max power
**After**: **128 max power** (EoSD authentic!)

### 2. Power Level Thresholds (EoSD Authentic)
| Level | Before | After (EoSD) |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| 2 | 20 power | **8 power** |
| 3 | 60 power | **16 power** |
| 4 | 100 power | **32 power** |
| 5 | N/A | **64 power** (NEW!) |

**Impact**: Power-ups feel more meaningful, progression is faster

### 3. Power-Up Shapes
**Before**: Circles ⭕
**After**: **Diamonds ◆** (rotated squares) - EoSD authentic!

**Visual**:
- Small Power: Red diamond with white center, "P" text
- Big Power: Larger red diamond with white center, "P" text
- Point Items: Blue square with white border

### 4. Power-Up Values (Already Fixed)
- Small Power: +1
- Big Power: +8
- Point: +10,000 score

### 5. Damage Scaling (Balanced)
**Player damage reduced ~30%** to match increased enemy HP

**Current Balance**:
- Reimu: 1.2 + (power/100) base damage
- Marisa: 1.8 + (power/90) base damage
- Enemies: 20 HP (was 5)

## 🎯 Remaining Authenticity Tasks

### High Priority:
1. **Dialogue Box** - Needs EoSD-style formatting
2. **Spell Card Phases** - Add missing spell cards (35 total)
3. **Enemy Density** - Need 2-3x more enemies in stages
4. **Bullet Patterns** - Increase density and complexity

### Medium Priority:
5. **Difficulty Scaling** - Implement Easy/Normal/Hard/Lunatic properly
6. **Graze System** - Add graze counter and mechanics
7. **Score System** - Authentic scoring with multipliers
8. **Item Collection Line** - Visual POC line at top of screen

### Low Priority:
9. **Visual Effects** - Bullet trails, explosions, etc.
10. **Sound Effects** - More authentic SFX
11. **Stage Backgrounds** - Scrolling backgrounds
12. **Boss Portraits** - Character art during dialogue
