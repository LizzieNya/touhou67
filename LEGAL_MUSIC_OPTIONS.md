- Add proper music later
- No copyright worries

### Option B: Make Your Own (Seriously!)
Use **Beepbox** (https://beepbox.co):
- Free online music maker

- 100% your own creation
- Sounds retro/authentic

### Option C: AI-Generated "Inspired By"
Use Suno AI with these prompts:
```
"Music inspired by U.N. Owen Was Her, fast chaotic piano, 
touhou style, original composition"
```

This creates NEW music that SOUNDS like the original but isn't copying it!
