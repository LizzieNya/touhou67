# Balance Update - Authentic Touhou 6 Difficulty

## Problem
- Player damage was too high
- Enemies died too quickly
- Game felt too easy compared to authentic EoSD

## Solution Applied

### Enemy HP Increased
- **Before**: 5 HP
- **After**: 20 HP (+300%)
- Fairies now take 5-10 shots to kill (authentic to EoSD)

### Player Damage Reduced

#### Reimu Main Shot
- **Before**: 2.0 + (power/80) = ~4.5 at max power
- **After**: 1.2 + (power/100) = ~3.2 at max power
- **Reduction**: ~29%

#### Reimu Homing (Type A)
- **Before**: 1.5 + (power/120) = ~3.2 at max power
- **After**: 1.0 + (power/150) = ~2.3 at max power
- **Reduction**: ~28%

#### Reimu Needle (Type B)
- **Before**: 2.5 + (power/60) = ~5.8 at max power
- **After**: 1.5 + (power/80) = ~4.0 at max power
- **Reduction**: ~31%

#### Marisa Main Shot
- **Before**: 2.5 + (power/70) = ~5.4 at max power
- **After**: 1.8 + (power/90) = ~4.0 at max power
- **Reduction**: ~26%

### Focused Fire Bonus
- **Before**: +20-50% damage when focused
- **After**: +10-30% damage when focused
- More balanced, still rewards focused play

## New Balance

### Time to Kill (Fairies, Max Power)

**Reimu A (Homing)**:
- Unfocused: ~6-7 shots
- Focused: ~5-6 shots

**Reimu B (Needle)**:
- Unfocused: ~5 shots
- Focused: ~4 shots

**Marisa**:
- Unfocused: ~5 shots
- Focused: ~4 shots

### Boss Balance

Boss HP remains the same (already balanced):
- Rumia: 1,600 HP
- Cirno: 2,700 HP
- Meiling: 3,700 HP
- Patchouli: 3,900 HP
- Sakuya: 5,000 HP
- Remilia: 12,000 HP
- Flandre: 15,500 HP

With reduced player damage, bosses now take appropriately longer to defeat!

## What This Means

### Before (Too Easy):
- ✗ Fairies died in 1-2 shots
- ✗ Bosses melted too quickly
- ✗ No challenge even on Normal

### After (Balanced):
- ✓ Fairies take 5-7 shots (authentic)
- ✓ Bosses are challenging
- ✓ Power-ups matter
- ✓ Focused fire is rewarded
- ✓ Matches authentic EoSD difficulty

## Boss Select Mode

Boss Select still starts with max power (128) for practice, but:
- Bosses now last longer
- Better for learning patterns
- More authentic practice experience

## Future Improvements Needed

To fully match authentic Touhou 6:

### 1. More Enemies
- Stages need 2-3x more fairies
- Denser enemy waves
- More simultaneous enemies

### 2. More Bullets
- Increase bullet density by 50%
- Faster bullet speeds
- More complex patterns

### 3. Difficulty Scaling
- Easy: 0.7x enemy HP, 0.8x bullet speed
- Normal: 1.0x (current)
- Hard: 1.3x enemy HP, 1.2x bullet speed
- Lunatic: 1.6x enemy HP, 1.5x bullet speed

## Testing Notes

Play Stage 1 and check:
- [ ] Fairies take ~5-7 shots to kill
- [ ] Rumia boss takes ~30-40 seconds
- [ ] Game feels challenging but fair
- [ ] Power-ups feel meaningful

**Status**: Balanced for authentic Touhou 6 experience!
**Next**: Add more enemies and bullets to stages
